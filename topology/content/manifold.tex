    \begin{definition}
        A topological space \(M\) is said to be locally Euclidean of dimension \(n\) if one of the following equivalent conditions hold.
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Every point \(p \in M\) has a neighborhood that is homeomorphic to an open subset of \(\mathbb{R}^n\).
            \item Every point \(p \in M\) has a neighborhood that is homeomorphic to an open ball in \(\mathbb{R}^n\).
            \item if every point \(p \in M\) has a neighborhood that is homeomorphic to \(\mathbb{R}^n\)
        \end{enumerate}
