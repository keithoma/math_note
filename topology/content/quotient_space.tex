\section{Definitions and Theorems}
\begin{defbox}
    \begin{definition}
        Let \((X, \mathcal{O})\) be a {\color{mathif}topological space}, and let \(\sim\) be an {\color{mathif}equivalence relation} on \(X\). The {\color{maththen}quotient set}, \(X / \sim\) is the {\color{mathobj}set} of {\color{mathobj}equivalence classes} of elements of \(X\). The equivalence class of \(x \in X\) is {\color{mathrem}denoted} \([x]\). The {\color{maththen}projection map} (also {\color{mathrem}quotient} or {\color{mathrem}canonical map}) associated with \(\sim\) refers to the following {\color{mathif}surjective map}:
        \begin{align*}
            \pi: X \longrightarrow X / \sim, \qquad x \mapsto [x]
        \end{align*}
        For any subset \(S \subset X / \sim\) (so in particular, \(s \subset X\) for every \(s \in S\))
        The quotient space under \(\sim\) is the quotient set \(X / \sim\) equipped with the quotient topology, which is the topology whose open sets are subsets \(U \subset Y = X / \sim\) such that \(\makeset{x \in X}{[x] \in U} = \bigcup_{u \in U}u\) is an open subset of \((X, \mathcal{O}_X)\); that is, \(U \subset X / \sim\)
    \end{definition}
\end{defbox}
\begin{thmbox}
    \begin{proposition}
        \(\mathcal{O}_{X / \sim}\) is the {\color{maththen}finest} {\color{mathobj}topology} in which the {\color{mathif}projection map} \(\pi: X \longrightarrow X / \sim\) is {\color{mathif}continuous}.
    \end{proposition}
\end{thmbox}
\begin{defbox}
    Let \(X\) and \(Y\) be topological spaces and let \(p: X \longrightarrow Y\) be a surjective map. The map is a quotient map (also said strong continuity) if one of the equivalent condition hold.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item A subset \(U \subset Y\) is open in \(Y\) if and only if the preimage \(p^{-1}(U)\) is open in \(X\).
        \item A subset \(U \subset Y\) is closed in \(Y\) if and only if the preimage \(p^{-1}(U)\) is closed in \(X\).
    \end{enumerate}

\begin{defbox}
    \begin{definition}
        Let \((X, \mathcal{O})\) be a {\color{mathif}topological space}, and let \(\sim\) be an {\color{mathif}equivalence relation} on \(X\). The {\color{maththen}quotient set}, \(X / \sim\) is the {\color{mathobj}set} of {\color{mathobj}equivalence classes} of elements of \(X\). The equivalence class of \(x \in X\) is {\color{mathrem}denoted} \([x]\). The {\color{maththen}projection map} (also {\color{mathrem}quotient} or {\color{mathrem}canonical map}) associated with \(\sim\) refers to the following {\color{mathif}surjective map}:
        \begin{align*}
            \pi: X \longrightarrow X / \sim, \qquad x \mapsto [x]
        \end{align*}
        For any subset \(S \subset X / \sim\) (so in particular, \(s \subset X\) for every \(s \in S\))
        The quotient space under \(\sim\) is the quotient set \(X / \sim\) equipped with the quotient topology, which is the topology whose open sets are subsets \(U \subset Y = X / \sim\) such that \(\makeset{x \in X}{[x] \in U} = \bigcup_{u \in U}u\) is an open subset of \((X, \mathcal{O}_X)\); that is, \(U \subset X / \sim\)
    \end{definition}
\end{defbox}
\begin{thmbox}
    \begin{proposition}
        \(\mathcal{O}_{X / \sim}\) is the {\color{maththen}finest} {\color{mathobj}topology} in which the {\color{mathif}projection map} \(\pi: X \longrightarrow X / \sim\) is {\color{mathif}continuous}.
    \end{proposition}
\end{thmbox}
\begin{defbox}
    Let \(X\) and \(Y\) be topological spaces and let \(p: X \longrightarrow Y\) be a surjective map. The map is a quotient map (also said strong continuity) if one of the equivalent condition hold.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item A subset \(U \subset Y\) is open in \(Y\) if and only if the preimage \(p^{-1}(U)\) is open in \(X\).
        \item A subset \(U \subset Y\) is closed in \(Y\) if and only if the preimage \(p^{-1}(U)\) is closed in \(X\).
    \end{enumerate}
\end{defbox}
\begin{remark}
    Quotient maps are continuous. There are quotient maps that are neither open nor closed maps.
