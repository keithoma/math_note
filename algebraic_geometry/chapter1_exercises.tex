\begin{exercise}
    Let \( Y \) be the plane curve \( y = x^2 \) (i.e., \( Y \) is the zero set of the polynomial \( f = y - x^2 \)). Show that \( A(Y) \) is isomorphic to a polynomial ring in one variable over \( k \).
\end{exercise}
\begin{solution}
    By definition ~\ref{def:affine_coordinate_ring}, we simply have \(A(Y) = k[X, Y] / (Y - X^2)\). The isomorphism follows from the isomorphism theorem and the map \(f: k[X, Y] \rightarrow k[X]\) where we set \(f(Y) = X^2\).
\end{solution}
\begin{exercise}
    Let \(Z\) be the plane curve \(xy = 1\). Show that \(A(Z)\) is not isomorphic to a polynomial ring in one variable over \(k\). 
\end{exercise}
\begin{solution}
    \(A(Z) = k[X, Y] / (XY - 1)\)

    We know \(A(Z)\) is an \(k\)-algebra (see remark). Consider \(f: k[X, Y] \longrightarrow k[T]\). We must have \(\ker{f} = (XY - 1)\), thus \(f(XY - 1) = 0\), so \(f(X) = 1 / f(Y)\)

    I'll think about the rigorous details later, but basically \(A(Z) \cong k[X, X^{-1}]\)
\end{solution}
\begin{exercise}
    Let \(f\) be any irreducible quadratic polynomial in \(k[X, Y]\), and let \(W\) be the conic defined by \(f\). Show that \(A(W)\) is isomorphic to \(A(Y)\) or \(A(Z)\). Which one is it when?
\end{exercise}
\begin{solution}
    Let \(f\) be irreducible.

    \(A(W) = k[X, Y] / (f)\)
    
    isn't this kinda clear ...? I'll come back to write it down rigorously, but in general ...
\end{solution}
